## 🔒 Security Hardening (New)

We have implemented industry-standard security measures to protect user data and integrity:

- **🔐 Secure Authentication:**
  - **PHP Sessions:** Replaced unsafe client-side storage with server-side `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` enabled cookies.
  - **Argon2 / BVcrypt:** Passwords are hashed using modern algorithms.

- **🛡️ Access Control:**
  - **Strict CORS:** API calls are restricted to trusted origins (Localhost) with credential validation.
  - **Ownership Verification:** Backend logic strictly enforces that users can only modify/delete resources they *actually* own (preventing IDOR attacks).

- **💉 Injection Protection:**
  - **Prepared Statements (PDO):** All database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL Injection.
  - **Input Sanitization:** Frontend and backend validation to mitigate XSS risks.
